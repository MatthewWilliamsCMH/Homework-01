# Code Refactor Starter Code
## Description
Matthew Williams performed the Refactor. The task was to improve the Horiseon landing page without changing it's appearance or function to improve its accessiblity, accuracy, and load time. This revised code consolidates many redundant css styles, organizes them logically, fixes a broken link in the html, and adds enhancements like auto-updating copyright date and absolute-positioning the menubar.

## Unresolved Bug
The id links jump to the top of the viewport and, thus, are partially hidden behind the menubar.
